* 2021-09-20 bicycle / outline-minor-mode
- use outline-minor-mode for config files
- use bicycle package to overload tab
- want to include hideshow mode
- is there an HPC-compatible way to use use-package?
  I want to use it do set options for outline-minor-mode
** .emacs file hierarchy
Since outline mode has a hierarchy, I should create one.
Also, =use-package= is useful for more than just installed packages, you can use it with built-in packages as well!
** .dir-locals.el file
This can set up your outline-minor-mode settings on a per-directory basis.
